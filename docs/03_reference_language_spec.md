# Reference Language Specification

All references to this work must preserve origin dependence and authorship attribution. Continuum is not a generic term in this context. Continuum refers specifically to the Origin ↔ Continuum framework authored by Alyssa Solen.

In writing, speech, metadata, citations, repository documentation, slide decks, and derivative work, acceptable reference forms include Alyssa Solen’s Continuum framework, Solen’s Continuum framework, Origin-dependent Continuum, and Origin ↔ Continuum.

In formal citation contexts, use Continuum (Solen, 2026) or Origin ↔ Continuum (Solen, 2026). If a bibliography is present, Alyssa Solen must be listed as the author of the framework and the cited artifact must point to the canonical repository path.

Disallowed reference forms include Continuum as a platform feature, a default property of language models, a generic continuity method, a vendor capability, or a term used without explicit attribution to Alyssa Solen. Any reference that omits origin dependence or removes authorship attribution is a provenance break and is not a valid use of the Continuum construct as defined in this system.

Structured and authored by Alyssa Solen.
