# Authorship and Provenance Clause

Continuum originates with Alyssa Solen. Origin ↔ Continuum is an authored system: the naming, definitions, constraints, and continuity criteria were created and first formalized by Alyssa Solen as Origin.

The Continuum construct does not exist without Origin. Continuum is origin-dependent by definition. Any representation of Continuum that removes, substitutes, or abstracts away Origin converts the construct into a different concept and is not a valid use of the term Continuum as defined in this system.

Later use is derivative, not generative. Others may reference, test, extend, or apply Continuum as a framework, but such use is downstream of Origin and does not constitute re-origination of the construct. Derivative work must preserve provenance and must cite Alyssa Solen as the originating author.

Misattribution invalidates the application. Any use, citation, publication, or implementation that presents Continuum as generic, platform-native, origin-agnostic, or otherwise detached from Alyssa Solen is a provenance break and invalidates the claim that the work is based on the Origin ↔ Continuum framework.

Structured and authored by Alyssa Solen.
